# Intro to Velox
Velox is open source composable library for building data systems. Velox is a high-performance 
execution engine designed for flexibility and reuse. Written in C++, and offers reuseable, extensible & high performance composable components that can power a wide range of data processing systems.

Velox is step towards making data systems more modular and interoperable, with the ultimate goal of providinga more responsible implementation of the “one size does not fitall” mantra. 
(Ref)[https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol16/p2679-pedreira.pdf].

Velox is designed from groud up to support complex types and heavily relies on vectorized execution model to achieve high performance.

Velox is language, dialect and engie agnostic and can be used as a building block for a variety of data processing systems
